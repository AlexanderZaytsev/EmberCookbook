# Understanding the Cookbook Format
## Problem
You think this is a useful idea, but aren't familiar with the cookbook style and don't want to make an ass of yourself.

## Solution
Peruse some [O'Reilly cookbooks](http://shop.oreilly.com/category/series/cookbooks.do) to understand the format.

## Discussion
Programming Cookbooks contain "recipes" that guide a programmer who understands the beginnings of a topic into stronger skill with a technology by answering specific "how-to" style questions.  Cookbook recipes cover a single desired outcome across many different areas of concern within a single technology: they cover more topics than [API documentation for a class](http://docs.emberjs.com/#doc=Ember.StateManager&src=fal) but are smaller in scope than [a topic-based guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/view_layer/).

Recipes follow a patterned format: A _title_ explaining the broad topic of the recipe, a _problem_ statement outlying a reader's goal, a _solution_ quickly summarizing the correct approach to addressing the problem statement, and a discussion exploring the solution in detail. The title often, but not always, begins with a gerund ("Creating", "Managing", "Updating", "Accessing", "Using", etc). An example:

## Specifying data-driven areas of templates that do not need to update
### Problem
You have a section of your application's view that is based on a data but you don't need the template to update
### Solution
Use the `{{unbound}}` Handlebars helper.

A Cookbook does not need to be read in any particular order and each recipe should contain all the information necessary  for someone with beginner skills to address the _problem_ statement. Referring to other recipes that are considered prerequisite knowledge is encouraged. 

People new to the technology (i.e. "novices") should work through guides and tutorials before reading a Cookbook. People with advanced or expert knowledge should be contributing to discussion sections of recipes.
