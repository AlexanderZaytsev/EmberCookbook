# Participating If You Don't Know Ember
## Problem
You are entirely or mostly new to Ember but wish to support the creation of this document.

## Solution
Watch this project on Github. You'll be notified through your Github account as we move through phases of the project.

## Discussion
The initial version of the Ember Cookbook will have a few phases. During the first phase you can suggest possible recipes by forking this project and submitting a pull request (See _Suggesting a Recipe_). During later phases we'll be asking for you help in proof reading and testing the recipes.

See ["Watch a project"](http://help.github.com/be-social/) on Github for information on watching projects.
