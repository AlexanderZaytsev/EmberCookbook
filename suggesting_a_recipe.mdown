# Suggesting a Recipe

## Problem
You'd like to submit a possible recipe.

## Solution
Fork this project and create a feature branch named after your recipe. Add a recipe providing a _title_, _problem_ statement, _solution_ statement, and empty discussion section.

## Discussion
A [feature branch](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a branch in a local git repository with a name describing the suggested feature. You should name this branch the camel cased or underscored version of your recipe name. The branch name for this recipe "Suggesting a Recipe" would be "`SuggestingARecipe`" or "`suggesting_a_recipe`".

Your _title_, _problem_, and _solution_ text should match the Cookbook style (see _Understanding the Cookbook Format_). For now, please leave the _discussion_ section empty. We'll fill this in during a later phase of the project.

The file name of your suggested recipe should be the lowercase underscored version of your recipe's name. The filename name for this recipe "Suggesting a Recipe" would be "`suggesting_a_recipe.mdown`".

When you are ready, push your local branch to the remote branch on your Github fork and submit a pull request.

Before submitting a pull request, check to see that someone hasn't already submitted a similar recipe and ensure that your recipe is a good fit (see _Deciding If A Recipe Is A Good Fit_).
